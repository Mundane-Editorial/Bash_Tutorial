Breakdown:

1. Shebang (#!/usr/bin/bash)
The shebang is the first line of a script that specifies the interpreter to be used when executing the script.
In your case, #!/usr/bin/bash tells the system that the script should be run using the Bash interpreter located
at /usr/bin/bash.

#!: This is the special sequence known as the shebang that indicates which interpreter to use.
/usr/bin/bash: The absolute path to the Bash interpreter on your system. Depending on the system, the path might
be /bin/bash or something else.

2. Blank Line
The blank line after the shebang is optional. It doesnâ€™t affect the execution of the script, but it's fine to 
leave it in for readability.

3. echo "Hello, Linux"
The echo command is used to print text to the terminal.
In this case, the script will output the text Hello, Linux when executed.



------------How the Script Works:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shebang tells the operating system to use Bash as the interpreter for this script.
When the script is executed, Bash interprets and runs the echo command, printing Hello, Linux to the terminal.
